Estrategia Topic Sentence

Aprender a identificar el tema y la idea principal en cada experiencia de lectura es crucial para comprender el mensaje central de los textos. Implementar técnicas efectivas de identificación es fundamental para visibilizar el tema y la idea principal de los textos.

Para identificar el tema, es esencial comprender qué asunto se explora en cada párrafo del texto. A veces, el tema está explícito en el título, pero cuando no es así, o para corroborarlo, se recomienda leer el texto completo y plantearse estratégicamente la pregunta: "¿De qué trata este texto?" Respondiendo esta pregunta de manera concisa, se identifica el tema del texto.

Otra técnica útil es identificar palabras clave, ya que su repetición a lo largo del texto puede revelar el tema central. Reconocer el tema nos facilita relacionar ideas y comprender mejor las perspectivas presentadas sobre ese tema específico.

# Lectura: Types of Web Development for Beginners

There are three types of web development roles: developers who specialize in the user interface (“front-end”), those who write the underlying code for running all website operations (“back-end”), and those who manage all aspects of a website (“full stack”). Each type focuses on a different area of web development, but they all have one thing in common: coding. A bachelor’s in computer science is a great way to learn the programming skills required for a web development career.

What are the different types of web development?

When users click on a website link, such as a “Pay Now” button, they rarely think about the underlying code that takes them to a payment page. Web developers are responsible for creating the look and feel of that button, as well as the logic that drives the website. Here are the three main types of web development:

•
Front-end web development
Front-end web development is responsible for the look and feel of a website. This means how colors, type, icons, and images appear. Increasingly, front-end development has to account for how a website looks on all devices, from desktop to tablet to phone. Typical programming languages include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Front-end developers keep up with cutting-edge trends in web design and development to make sure websites are optimized for users and search engines — and with security best practices in mind.

•
Back-end web development
Back-end web development is responsible for building and maintaining the code that runs a website. This code connects the website to the server and ensures that data flows properly to the website and that transactions are processed correctly. Typical programming languages include Java (different from JavaScript), PHP, and MySQL; newer tools include Python and Golang. Back-end web developers can keep up with changes in technology by participating in networking communities that share coding tips and support.

•
Full-stack web development
Full-stack web development covers both front-end and back-end responsibilities. Depending on the complexity of a website, a full-stack developer may be responsible for all facets of its development, from the server side to the user interface. Many full-stack developers may still specialize in one aspect of web development, but their broad experience is useful in troubleshooting or speeding up a build or redesign. Full-stack developers are often responsible for identifying cutting-edge technologies, such as enhanced programming languages (or even no- or low-code trends) and blockchain, that can be used to strengthen websites’ business capabilities.
