# Tema 1: Analyzing words

[Estrategias para analizar palabras en el texto: Word formation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-INTAwWLX4)

Identificar los componentes de las palabras es fundamental para comprender y derivar su significado. En este contexto, exploraremos los afijos, es decir, sílabas o partículas que se añaden al inicio o al final de las palabras raíz para formar nuevas palabras.

- Prefijos:

Los prefijos son aquellos que se encuentran al inicio de las palabras, como en el caso de "preview": la palabra raíz es "view" (vista), y el prefijo "pre" significa "previo" o "anterior". Así, "preview" se traduce como "vista previa" o "previsualización". Aprender los prefijos más comunes resultará muy útil para comprender o deducir el significado de numerosas palabras, enriqueciendo significativamente tu vocabulario

- Sufijos:

Por otro lado, los sufijos son afijos que se añaden al final de las palabras y modifican su función gramatical, como en el caso de "reader" (lector): la palabra raíz es la forma base del verbo "leer" (read), y al agregar el sufijo "-er", transformamos el verbo en un sustantivo que denota la acción de leer.

A continuación, veremos algunos de los prefijos y sufijos más utilizados:

# Lectura: Java Programming Language

The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Although it is primarily used for Internet-based applications, Java is a simple, efficient, general-purpose language. Java was originally designed for embedded network applications running on multiple platforms. It is a portable, object-oriented, interpreted language.

Java is extremely portable. The same Java application will run identically on any computer, regardless of hardware features or operating system, as long as it has a Java interpreter. Besides portability, another of Java's key advantages is its set of security features which protect a PC running a Java program not only from problems caused by erroneous code but also from malicious programs (such as viruses). You can safely run a Java applet downloaded from the Internet, because Java's security features prevent these types of applets from accessing a PC's hard drive or network connections. An applet is typically a small Java program that is embedded within an HTML page.

Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter. The use of compiled byte-code allows the interpreter (the virtual machine) to be small and efficient (and nearly as fast as the CPU running native, compiled code). In addition, this byte-code gives Java its portability: it will run on any JVM that is correctly implemented, regardless of computer hardware or software configuration. Most Web browsers (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator) contain a JVM to run Java applets.

## Interesting facts Tema 1

History of Java

[Interesting Facts 1 - Inglés Misión 1 Talento Tech 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sct0ykkZHEg)

Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.

After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.

Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.

In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.

Why had they chose the name Java for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell, and fun to say.

Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.

Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.
