Estrategias para encontrar la idea principal

Main Idea
Cuando aprendemos a identificar la idea principal en un texto, aprendemos a desglosar los aspectos más importantes del mismo como el tema, lo que se dice del tema y los detalles complementarios que apoyan la información presentada

Step 1

Para poder entender la idea principal de un texto, debemos, en primera instancia, identificar el tema. El tema es la palabra o la frase a la todo el párrafo se está refiriendo.

Este primer paso es generalmente algo sencillo ya que, especialmente en textos académicos o informativos, los párrafos inician con una oración clave que nos deja saber el tema que se estará desarrollando en las ideas presentadas en las siguientes oraciones. Esta oración es llamada “Topic sentence” (Oración temática). Sin embargo, no siempre las primeras oraciones nos entregan pistas claras del tema o de la idea principal del texto, no siempre encontramos la idea de manera implícita. En esos casos debemos estar mucho más atentos para poder identificar la información clave en los párrafos prestando atención a las palabras que se repiten, o a el tema del que se está haciendo constante referencia en los detalles del texto.



Ejemplo: 

The “Python library” contains several different kinds of components. It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the “core” of a language, such as numbers and lists. For these types, the Python language core defines the form of literals and places some constraints on their semantics, but does not fully define the semantics. (On the other hand, the language core does define syntactic properties like the spelling and priorities of operators.)

Tema: Python library

En esta primera oración podemos ver como el tema está implícito en la primera línea.

Step 2

Una vez tengamos identificado el tema del párrafo, podemos corroborar este hallazgo al responder la siguiente pregunta en un par palabras: ¿Dé que trata este párrafo? / What is this paragraph about?

Ejemplo: ¿De qué trata este párrafo? / What is this paragraph about? 

Python Lybrary (Dos palabras)

Tema: Python Lybrary

Step 3

Aplicaremos la siguiente fórmula para esclarecer cuál es la idea principal del texto: Tema + Ideas que se exploran sobre el tema

Ejemplo: The “Python library” contains several different kinds of components. It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the “core” of a language, such as numbers and lists. 

Tema: The “Python library”

La información más importante que se dice del tema:contains several different kinds of components. It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the “core” of a language, such as numbers and lists.

Step 4

Verificar cuál es la idea principal contestando con una o dos oraciones la siguiente pregunta: ¿De qué trata este párrafo? / What is this paragraph about?

Ejemplo: ¿De qué trata este párrafo? / What is this paragraph about? 

The “Python library” contains several different kinds of components. It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the “core” of a language, such as numbers and lists.  (Dos oraciones)

## Lectura: Artificial intelligence


Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.

What is intelligence?

All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.

Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.

Learning

There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.
